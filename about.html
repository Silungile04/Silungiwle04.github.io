    <p>“Safety and security don’t just happen; they are a collective consensus and public investment. We owe our children, the most vulnerable citizens in our society, a life free of violence and fear,”- Nelson Mandela. </p>
    <p>“There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its children,” said Nelson Mandela. That is why this academy focuses on making better the lives of many children. We want to follow in his footsteps of making a better South Africa with education.</p>
    <p>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are we not to be?’’- Marianne Williamson   </p>
